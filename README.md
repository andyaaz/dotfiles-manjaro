# Andy's Dot files on his manjaro

mainly consists of program configurations (e.g. vim, zsh, git, etc)

vscode config will not be stored here (instead setting sync is used)

# For my future self

## How to use (correctly)

- git clone anywhere
- create symlinks for config you want to use in home dir locally

## Don'ts

- copy them to home dir (will end up with two diff versions)
- put files with creds in here
